SECTION 5 - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR LINK 16
5. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR LINK 16
5.1 DESCRIPTION OF J-SERIES MESSAGES
5.1.1 This section describes the Link 16 fixed format message construction and provides word applicability tables, message summaries, word maps, word descriptions, word notes, field coding, transmit tables, and receive tables for the Link 16 messages.
5.1.2 Paragraph 5.2 through Paragraph 5.9, contained herein, define the requirements for the Link 16 header, initial word, extension word, and continuation word. Included are the requirements for message construction and formats, message and word numbering conventions, coding conventions, and message priority.
5.1.3 Paragraph 5.11, contained in six separate volumes (parts), presents the detailed requirements for each Link 16 message and word.

5.2  HEADER WORD 
 
5.2.1  At the start of each time slot, a 35 bit header is transmitted.  The header is then followed by one or more messages.  The header is not a part of the message structure, but the information contained in it applies to all messages within the time slot.  The header contains the Time Slot Type, Relayed Transmission Indicator, Type Modification, SDU Serial Number and the Source TN fields.  The SDU Serial Number field is supplied by the transmitting terminal.  The Source TN field is supplied by the host system identifying the originator of the message in the time slot.  The Header format is shown in Figure 5.2- 1.

5.3 MESSAGE CONSTRUCTION

5.3.1 Link 16 messages are functionally-oriented, variable-length strings of 75-bit words. A message is started by an initial word, which may then be followed by extension words to transmit logically associated data field groupings longer than can be accommodated by the initial word. The extension words may be followed by continuation words, which supply supplemental information that is normally transmitted on an infrequent basis. There may be multiple Link 16 messages, varying in function, within a time slot. However, each message shall reside and be capable of interpretation totally within a single time slot.

5.3.2 WORD CONSTRUCTION
5.3.2.1 The following paragraphs describe Link 16 word construction.

5.3.3 GENERAL
5.3.3.1 Each 75-bit word contains a 5-bit Parity field. For a description of Parity encoding, see the JTIDS/MIDS Technical Characteristics, Section 3, Terms and Definitions. Each 75-bit word is uniquely identified as an initial word, an extension word or a continuation word. For this identification, each word contains a 2-bit Word Format field. The Word Format field is interpreted as follows:
	a. WF = 002 Indicates an initial word.
	b. WF = l02 Indicates an extension word.
	c. WF = 0l2 Indicates a continuation word.
	d. WF = ll2 Indicates a variable message format word.

5.3.4 INITIAL WORD
5.3.4.1 Figure 5.3-1 shows the format for an initial word. Each initial word contains a 5-bit Label, Link 16 field; a 3-bit Sublabel, Link 16 field; and a 3-bit Message Length Indicator (MLI) field. Each combination of a specific label and sublabel defines one of 256 possible combinations.

5.3.4.2 The MLI field indicates the total number of extension and/or continuation words that follow the initial word. This is provided as an additional aid to maintaining orientation in the word stream and to speed discarding filtered messages. See also Paragraph 5.5.

Figure 5.3-1. J Series Initial Word Format

5.3.5 EXTENSION WORD
5.3.5.1 Figure 5.3-2 shows the format for an extension word. 
Extension words are defined for an initial word when the length of the data field groupings logically transmitted as an entity exceeds the space available in the initial word. Since the data fields in the extension words are defined and interpreted solely with respect to the label and sublabel field combination in the initial word, they must be transmitted in serial order. For example, if the jth extension word of the n extension words defined for a given initial word is to be transmitted, all "i" words, i is less than j, must precede the jth word. If any extension word is to be repeated, it must be the last extension word for that message.

5.3.6 CONTINUATION WORD
5.3.6.1 Figure 5.3-3 shows the format for a continuation word.  Continuation words provide additional amplifying information in support of the initial word and extension words. Continuation words are transmitted after the last extension word, or immediately after the initial word if no extension words are transmitted. Each continuation word contains a 5-bit Continuation Word Label field used to uniquely identify the continuation word. The Continuation Word Label field can be defined for values from 0 through 3l, allowing for a maximum of 32 continuation words for any sublabel. Unlike extension words, continuation words can be sent in any order unless otherwise specified in individual message transmission rules.

5.4 MESSAGE AND WORD NUMBERING CONVENTION
5.4.1 The following numbering convention is defined to identify the J series fixed format messages and words.

5.4.2 MESSAGE
5.4.2.1 Jn.m is the numbering convention for a Link 16 message, i.e., a combination of one initial word, and any legal combination of extension and continuation words, where n is the Label, Link 16 field value and 0 is less than or equal to n is less than or equal to 31, and m is the Sublabel, Link 16 field value and 0 is less than or equal to m is less than or equal to 7.
	a. For example, J3.2 is the numbering convention for the Air Track message.
	b. Jn.m(y) is the numbering convention for certain messages containing a sub-sublabel. This convention is used for the J27 series of national messages and will be used for all other national message series to be assigned in the future. These national messages contain a 5-bit sub-sublabel (represented by "y" above) which results in 32 national messages within each sublabel, i.e., 0 is less than or equal to y is less than or equal to 31. For example, J27.1 (0) is the numbering convention for the Japan National 1 message.

5.4.3 BASIC MESSAGE
5.4.3.1 Jn.mB is the numbering convention for a Link 16 Basic message, i.e., a combination of an initial word and all extension words that make up a minimum-length message as defined in the T/R rules for the message.
5.4.3.2 For example, J3.2B is the numbering convention for the Air Track Basic message consisting of the J3.2I Air Track initial word and the J3.2E0 Air Track extension word.

5.4.4 INITIAL WORD
5.4.4.1 Jn.mI is the numbering convention for the initial word for a Jn.m message.
5.4.4.2 For example, J3.2I is the numbering convention for the initial word for the J3.2 Air Track message.

5.4.5 EXTENSION WORD
5.4.5.1 Jn.mEx is the numbering convention for the extension word x for the Jn.m message, where x is a decimal number from 0 through the limitation imposed by the MLI field.
5.4.5.2 For example, J3.2E0 is the numbering convention for the first extension word for the J3.2 Air Track message.

5.4.6 CONTINUATION WORD
5.4.6.1 Jn.mCx is the numbering convention for the continuation word x for the Jn.m message, where x is a number from 0 through 31.
5.4.6.2 For example, J3.2C1 is the number of the first continuation word for the J3.2 Air Track message. (NOTE: Continuation word number 0 is not currently defined for any messages.  Therefore, continuation word number 1 is actually the first defined continuation word of all currently defined messages.)

5.5 MESSAGE LENGTH INDICATOR FIELD AND MESSAGE LENGTH
5.5.1 MESSAGE LENGTH INDICATOR FIELD
5.5.1.1 The MLI field in the initial word indicates the number 
of extension plus continuation words that follow the initial word. 
For Link 16 messages currently defined, the MLI field is three bits in 
length, allowing from zero through seven "following" words.
5.5.2 MESSAGE LENGTH
5.5.2.1 A time slot carries three words when the terminal is 
operating a Standard DP message packing structure; six words with a 
Packed-2 structure, and twelve words with Packed-4. The message 
construction rules (see Paragraph 5.3) state that each J-Series 
message must be capable of interpretation totally within a single time 
slot. Thus, the maximum possible length of message is three words in 
Standard DP (packing structure limit), six words in Packed-2 (packing 
structure limit), and eight words in Packed-4 (MLI field limit). In 
this latter case, the MLI would be set to value 7 to indicate seven 
additional extension and/or continuation words following the initial 
word.
MIL-STD-6016G
5-21
5.6 CODING CONVENTIONS
5.6.1 To minimize incompatibilities in the interface design and 
programming, certain coding conventions have been adopted and are 
described in the following paragraphs.
5.6.2 POSITION INFORMATION
5.6.2.1 The position of a track or point shall be expressed in 
latitude and longitude, as defined by the WGS-84, with geoid 
parameters 6,378,137 meters for equatorial radius and 1/298.257223563 
for polar flattening. Position shall normally be sent extrapolated to 
the instant of transmission, except for non-real-time tracks, 
ballistic missile tracks, and entities reported in J11.X messages.
5.6.3 VERTICAL POSITION MEASUREMENT
5.6.3.1 The vertical measurement of the position of a track, 
whether expressed as altitude, elevation, height, etc., shall be 
reported as measured radially outward from the center of the earth to 
the track as a positive quantity in units of feet above mean sea level 
(MSL), where the MSL datum is defined by the WGS-84 Geoid, unless 
otherwise stated, e.g., above ground level (AGL) or height above 
ellipsoid (HAE).
5.6.3.2 WGS-84 defines two elevation references: MSL and HAE. 
MSL is the earth's gravitational equipotential surface coinciding with 
sea level which varies with the mass distribution of the earth. In 
other words, the force of gravity at every point on the MSL geoid is 
the same as that at the average ocean level. HAE references an 
ellipsoid which is the best fit geometric representation of the MSL 
geoid. Because the MSL geoid is not a uniform and regular surface, 
the differences between MSL and HAE vary around the earth. The 
magnitude of the differences between MSL and HAE range from -345 feet 
to 279 feet (negative values indicating that MSL is above the
MIL-STD-6016G
5-22
reference ellipsoid at that location). HAE Adjustment and HAE 
Adjustment 1 provide a means to report the offset between MSL and HAE 
for the location specified in a message so that the vertical 
measurement can be referenced to HAE as well as MSL. When the 
elevation is below mean sea level, HAE Adjustment and HAE Adjustment 1 
provide a means to report the vertical measurement directly referenced 
to HAE, rather than as an offset from MSL.
5.6.4 VELOCITY INFORMATION
5.6.4.1 Velocity information shall be transmitted as course and 
speed. Course shall be expressed in degrees referenced to true north 
(true north and geographic north are considered synonymous) unless 
otherwise stated. Speed is defined as the rate of change of position 
over the ground and is expressed in data miles per hour unless 
otherwise stated.
5.6.5 COURSE/BEARING INFORMATION
5.6.5.1 All Course/Bearings shall be in degrees, referenced to 
true north. Any conversion to magnetic north or other relative values 
shall be performed by the host systems.
5.6.6 TIME INFORMATION
5.6.6.1 Ideally, a JU establishes network time using GPS derived 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)/U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) Time as 
the preferred time source to set its terminal clock. Any required 
conversion to local time shall be performed by the host systems.
5.6.7 DATA FIELD CODING
5.6.7.1 The data fields used in the interface are of two types, 
logical and numeric. Logical data fields are fields whose bit 
configurations represent logical values as described in the applicable
MIL-STD-6016G
5-23
message definition. Numeric data fields are multi-bit fields whose 
bit configurations represent actual numeric values. The least 
significant bit value and the value range are described in the 
applicable message definition. Unless otherwise specified, all data 
fields are read from left to right (higher bit number to lower bit 
number), with the most significant bit on the left.
5.6.8 SPARE FIELDS
5.6.8.1 Spare fields are included in some messages. When 
transmitted these spare fields will be encoded as zero and shall not 
be processed upon receipt. Messages shall not be discarded upon 
receipt of non-zero spare fields.
5.6.8.2 Disused fields are spare fields that previously had a 
valid meaning. When transmitted, Disused fields shall be encoded as 0 
and shall not be processed upon receipt. Messages shall not be 
discarded upon receipt of a non-zero Disused field.
5.6.8.3 One or more of the bits of a Disused field cannot be 
renamed without considering coordinated implementation. Once one or 
more bits of a Disused field have been so reused the remaining bits, 
if any, shall be renamed as a Spare field or, if not contiguous, Spare 
fields.
5.6.9 NEGATIVE VALUES
5.6.9.1 A negative number shall be coded and transmitted with 
twos complement coding and identified by the number one in the most 
significant bit of the data field. Conversion to ones complement 
coding, when required by a TDS, shall be provided by the JTIDS/MIDS 
terminal.
MIL-STD-6016G
5-24
5.6.10 PROTECTIVE CODING
5.6.10.1 All interface units shall design and program in such a 
manner that they are protected in case they receive a message 
containing illegal values. Messages shall not be discarded upon 
receipt of undefined or disused values of defined fields, except in 
the case of values which if received would render the message 
unusable. When messages are received containing undefined or disused 
values of defined fields, and other data fields of the message could 
be processed and interpreted properly, the field containing the 
undefined or disused values shall be processed as the No Statement or 
default value, and the other fields of the message shall be processed 
as implemented.
5.6.11 FIELDS NOT IMPLEMENTED
5.6.11.1 IUs that have not implemented any values of a field 
shall transmit a No Statement value for that field or an equivalent 
value which is specified in Section 5, Part 4, Transmit Tables.
5.6.12 NO STATEMENT/NO DATA
5.6.12.1 The no statement/no data value shall be coded as the 
zero value except when zero is a valid numeric value. In this case 
the no statement/no data value shall be the maximum value possible for 
that field. In each case where the data item (DI) meaning is No 
Statement or No Statement combined with other DI meanings, such as 
Unknown, Pending, Other, Estimated, General, etc., the DI indicates 
that no data are being reported for the affected data element.
MIL-STD-6016G
5-25
5.7 MESSAGE DESCRIPTION DOCUMENTATION
5.7.1 Table 5.7-1 lists the Link 16 fixed format messages. The 
messages are described by the following:
a. Word Applicability Table. The Word Applicability Table lists 
the valid initial words for each Label, Link 16 value and the valid 
extension and continuation words for each Sublabel, Link 16 value 
within that label. A separate table is provided for each Label, Link 
16 value.
b. Message Summary. The message summary contains the message 
purpose and provides a list of the data elements comprising each word 
in the message. The message summary also lists the bit length of each 
data element. A separate message summary is provided for each Link 16 
message defined by a valid combination of label and sublabel.
c. Implementation Requirements. The implementation requirements 
define the information that must be exchanged in order to 
interoperate. Separate implementation requirements are provided for 
each Link 16 message by function in Appendix A, Implementation 
Requirements.
d. Link 16 Word Presentation. The format and content of each 
initial, extension, and continuation word comprising a Link 16 message 
is defined by a word map; a word description; word notes, when 
applicable; and field coding. The word map shows the field 
construction for each word. The word description provides, for each 
data element within the word, a Data Field Identifier (DFI)/Data Use 
Identifier (DUI) reference number; a field descriptor when applicable; 
bit positions of the data element within the message; length of the 
data element, in bits; and any applicable resolution and coding. 
Notes are provided when necessary to further explain data elements and 
message construction. Field coding provides the definition of each 
value of each data element.

5.9 MESSAGE PRIORITY SCHEME
5.9.1 Link 16 messages transmitted by the JTIDS/MIDS terminal 
are generated both by the terminal and by the host unit's TDS. Both 
of these sources generate certain messages in accordance with specific 
transmission rules. In the event that there are more messages 
eligible for transmission than can be accommodated within an allocated 
time slot, a priority scheme is required. This priority code shall be 
assigned by the host system to each category of message type generated 
for transmission. Message priorities shall be set as indicated in 
Table 3.1-2, Terminal Input Message Information.
5.9.1.1 The assignment of priority codes to different message 
types is dependent on host integration options. Higher priority codes 
shall not be allocated to message types containing changes of data or 
originated in response to a Data Update Request compared to the 
priority code allocated to the same message type for routine 
reporting. This will prevent the reporting of changed data for an 
entity from "queue jumping" the reporting of old data for the same 
entity which would result in unnecessary changes of old data by 
receiving JUs. The exception to this is a track report of a change of 
Identity to or from Hostile, which will always have a High priority.
5.9.1.1.1 The host system message priorities shall be in 
accordance with the relative priorities allocated to each message type 
in Table 3.1-2 and as follows:
a. If the host system has to delay the processing and message 
generation of one message type due to the concurrent processing and 
message generation of another type, then the processing of the message 
type with the higher priority shall take precedence.
b. If the host system has to delay the processing and message 
generation of one message type due to the concurrent processing and 
message generation of a message type of the same priority level, then
MIL-STD-6016G
5-34
the processing and message generation of the message which has been 
waiting longest shall have precedence.
5.9.1.2 The relative priority levels in Table 3.1-2 are given as 
High, Medium or Low and are intended to indicate the priority 
philosophy to be adopted.
5.9.1.2.1 Some message types are generated as a result of a 
cyclic timer of defined period. If the required rate of generation of 
cyclically generated message types in a NPG would result in the total 
number of messages required for transmission in that NPG exceeding the 
number of available timeslots assigned to that NPG, then the rate of 
generation of these message types in that NPG shall be reduced to the 
maximum level which just allows all messages for that NPG to be 
transmitted. C2 JU operators may be alerted if the reduction in the 
rate of generation of a cyclically generated message type exceeds 
twice the normal cyclic rate.
5.9.1.2.2 C2 JUs may provide operator discretionary capability 
to superimpose high priority precedence on otherwise medium or low 
automatic or operator generated transmissions of the messages 
described below.
- A J10.2 Engagement Status message being reported by the C2 JU.
- A J3.X (X = 0-7) or J5.4 message for which the C2 JU has R2.
All messages of the same priority shall be transmitted in the order 
generated, i.e., first in/first out (FIFO), except that more recently 
generated messages may be transmitted when all older messages of the 
same priority comprise more words than can be accommodated in the 
space remaining in a time slot.

5.10 HOST INITIALIZATION VARIABLE PARAMETERS
5.10.1 Certain data and/or parameters within algorithms are 
variable. The parameter to be used will be disseminated via the 
OPTASK LINK. In the absence of direction from the OPTASK LINK, the 
default value shall be used. Several variable parameters are stated 
using the form a(b-c,d), where a is equal to the default value, b and 
c are equal to the lower and upper bounds of the variable, and d is 
equal to the increments by which the parameter may be changed. Some 
examples are the ∆t used in the Ballistic Missile Track Quality 
algorithm and the variable TQ value for Ballistic Missile Reporting 
Responsibility rules. An example of variable parameters not stated 
using the a(b-c,d) form is the Operational Commander defined values.
