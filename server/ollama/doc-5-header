SECTION 5 - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR LINK 16
5. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR LINK 16
5.1 DESCRIPTION OF J-SERIES MESSAGES
5.1.1 This section describes the Link 16 fixed format message construction and provides word applicability tables, message summaries, word maps, word descriptions, word notes, field coding, transmit tables, and receive tables for the Link 16 messages.
5.1.2 Paragraph 5.2 through Paragraph 5.9, contained herein, define the requirements for the Link 16 header, initial word, extension word, and continuation word. Included are the requirements for message construction and formats, message and word numbering conventions, coding conventions, and message priority.
5.1.3 Paragraph 5.11, contained in six separate volumes (parts), presents the detailed requirements for each Link 16 message and word.

5.2  HEADER WORD 
 
5.2.1  At the start of each time slot, a 35 bit header is transmitted.  The header is then followed by one or more messages.  The header is not a part of the message structure, but the information contained in it applies to all messages within the time slot.  The header contains the Time Slot Type, Relayed Transmission Indicator, Type Modification, SDU Serial Number and the Source TN fields.  The SDU Serial Number field is supplied by the transmitting terminal.  The Source TN field is supplied by the host system identifying the originator of the message in the time slot.  The Header format is shown in Figure 5.2- 1.
